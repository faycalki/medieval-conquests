#   Each game menu is a tuple that contains the following fields:
#  
#  1) Game-menu id (string): used for referencing game-menus in other files.
#     The prefix menu_ is automatically added before each game-menu-id
#
#  2) Game-menu flags (int). See header_game_menus.py for a list of available flags.
#     You can also specify menu text color here, with the menu_text_color macro
#  3) Game-menu text (string).
#  4) mesh-name (string). Not currently used. Must be the string "none"
#  5) Operations block (list). A list of operations. See header_operations.py for reference.
#     The operations block is executed when the game menu is activated.
#  6) List of Menu options (List).
#     Each menu-option record is a tuple containing the following fields:
#   6.1) Menu-option-id (string) used for referencing game-menus in other files.
#        The prefix mno_ is automatically added before each menu-option.
#   6.2) Conditions block (list). This must be a valid operation block. See header_operations.py for reference. 
#        The conditions are executed for each menu option to decide whether the option will be shown to the player or not.
#   6.3) Menu-option text (string).
#   6.4) Consequences block (list). This must be a valid operation block. See header_operations.py for reference. 
#        The consequences are executed for the menu option that has been selected by the player.
